<h2>ðŸ“• About</h2>

**Organomovies** it's my own version of a project developed in the Alura React course. I created this project to solidify the knowledge and learning acquired during the course. The project allows you to add movies by providing their name, your opinion about the movie, an image, and genre. This way, a collection of movies is created and organized by their respective genres.

<h2> ðŸ”¨ Tools </h2>

- Javascript
- React
